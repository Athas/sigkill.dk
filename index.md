Troels Henriksen's website
================================

Welcome to my website.  My name is Troels Henriksen, and I am a Danish
hacker ([more about me][1]) and general enthusiast in all matters
computing.

On this site I present [programs I have written][2], my [configuration
files][3], and [minor scripts][4] that may of some amusement to
others.  I also used to [blog][5], although not any more.

For those curious about technical details, this site is written in
shell script and Markdown (yes, really) via the amazing [werc][6]
framework.
