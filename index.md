Troels Henriksen's website
================================

Welcome to my website.  My name is Troels Henriksen, and I am a Danish
hacker ([more about me][1]) and general enthusiast in all matters
computing.

On this site I present [programs I have written][2], my [configuration
files][3], and [minor scripts][4] that may of some amusement to
others.  I also used to [blog][5], although not any more.  I tend to
create categories before content (curiously mirroring my interest in
type theory), so parts of the site may seem skeletal.  Please excuse
my pompous introductions for folders containing naught but a five-line
shell script.

For those curious about technical details, this site is statically
generated via the nifty Hakyll framework, although it used to be
written in shell script via the pretty good [werc anti-framework][6].
The source code is available [here][sigkillsource].
