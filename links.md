Links to cool websites
======================

In the early days in the web, before search engines and centralised
link repositories (think [Reddit](https://reddit.com)) took over
everything, every personal web page would have links to the personal
pages of other people.  Personal web pages are nothing like what they
used to me (most just rank Twitter it seems), but there are still some
cool ones around.  Here's a list of the ones I think are worth
checking out.

* [Dan Luu](https://danluu.com/) is a programmer and writes
  interesting and very well-researched articles.  [The one on computer
  input lag](https://danluu.com/input-lag/) is particularly worth
  checking out.

* [Drew DeVault](https://drewdevault.com/) is the hacker behind things
  like [sway](https://swaywm.org/) (an i3 clone for Wayland),
  [sourcehut](https://sr.ht), and more (a source code and CI hosting
  site).  I really like his style of program design and his blog is
  very interesting.

* [John Regehr](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~regehr/) is a professor at
  the University of Utah, and while his web page is very boring, [his
  blog](https://blog.regehr.org/) is interesting.  He tends to write
  about compilers and the horrors of undefined behaviour.

* [Niels G. W. Serup](http://metanohi.name/) is one of my friends and
  he writes about important matters such as [why you should insert two
  spaces after a period](http://metanohi.name/two-spaces).
