The even primes
===

A natural number *k* is said to *prime* if it is divisible only by 1
and itself.  Prime numbers have become very important to modern
society, and encryption in particular is based on sophisticated
principles of the prime numbers.

This page contains a number of theorems and lemmas on a subset of the
prime numbers, namely the set of *even* prime numbers.  No proofs are
given, as I wish the reader to experience the joy of reproducing these
fundamental truths himself.

Do you know any other theorems on the even primes?  Feel free to send
them to me, and I'll put them up there.

Finiteness
---

The set of even primes is quite finite.

Countability
---

The set of even primes is
[countable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countable).  In fact, the
even primes are *very easily* countable.

Troels' Identity
---

The sum of any non-empty set of even primes is equal to one plus the
number of elements in the set.

Convergence
---

When summing a sequence of *n* even primes, as *n* goes towards
infinity, the sum of the sequence will (very rapidly) approach *2n*.
